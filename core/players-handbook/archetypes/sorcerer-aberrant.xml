			<p class="flavor">Wield Unnatural Psionic Power</p>
			<p>An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a terror to those who feel the stab of your mind?</p>
			<p class="indent">Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed to the Far Realm’s warping influence. Alternatively, you were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer never occurred; now the tadpole’s psionic power is yours. However you acquired this power, your mind is aflame with it.</p>

			<p>You can unleash a space-warping anomaly. As a Magic action, you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC.
