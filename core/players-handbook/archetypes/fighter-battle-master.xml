			<p class="indent">You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice when you reach Fighter levels 7, 10, and 15. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p>

			<p class="indent">You gain an additional Superiority Die when you reach Fighter levels 7 (five dice total) and 15 (six dice total).</p>
			<p><strong><em>Saving Throws.</em></strong> If a maneuver requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) and Proficiency Bonus.</p>
