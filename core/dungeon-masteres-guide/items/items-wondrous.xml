		<description>
			<p>This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. The jug sloshes when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can take a Magic action and name one liquid from the <i>Alchemy Jug</i> Liquids table to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as a Utilize action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can’t produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.</p>

	<element name="Apparatus of Kwalish" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide 2024" id="ID_WOTC_DMG24_MAGIC_ITEM_APPARATUS_OF_KWALISH">
		<description>
			<p>This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.</p>
			<p class="indent">The <i>Apparatus of Kwalish</i> is a Large object with the following statistics:</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:-15px"><b>Armor Class:</b> 20</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom:-15px"><b>Hit Points:</b> 200</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom:-15px"><b>Speed:</b> 30 ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren’t extended)</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><b>Damage Immunities:</b> Poison, Psychic</p>
			<p>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>
			<p class="indent">The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute from pressure.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature in the compartment can take a Utilize action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.</p>

	<element name="Baba Yaga’s Dancing Broom" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide 2024" id="ID_WOTC_DMG24_MAGIC_ITEM_BABA_YAGAS_DANCING_BROOM">
		<description>
			<p>The archfey Baba Yaga crafted many of these magic brooms. No two appear exactly alike. While holding the broom, you can take a Magic action to transform it into an Animated Broom under your control. The broom then moves into an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The broom acts immediately after you on your Initiative count and remains animate until you take a Bonus Action and use a command word to render it inanimate.</p>
			<p class="indent">On your turn, you can mentally command the animated broom if it is within 30 feet of you and you don’t have the Incapacitated condition (no action required). You decide what action the broom takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the broom is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it shatters and is destroyed. If the broom reverts to its inanimate form before losing all its Hit Points it regains all of them.</p>

	<element name="Bag of Beans" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide 2024" id="ID_WOTC_DMG24_MAGIC_ITEM_BAG_OF_BEANS">
		<description>
			<p>This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of how many beans it contains and becomes a nonmagical item when it no longer contains any beans.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you dump one or more beans out of the bag, they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the explosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an effect from the following table or determine it randomly.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>1d100</td><td>Effect</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr><td>01</td><td>	5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 Poison damage and have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 Temporary Hit Points for 1 hour.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>02-10</td><td>A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, mayonnaise, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (DM’s choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d4 minutes.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>11-20</td><td>A Treant sprouts. Roll any die. On an odd roll, the treant is Chaotic Evil. On an even roll, the treant is Chaotic Good.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>21-30</td><td>An animate but immobile stone statue in your likeness rises and makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>31-40</td><td>A campfire with green flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours or until it is extinguished.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>41-50</td><td>Three Shrieker Fungi sprout.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>51-60</td><td>1d4 + 4 bright-pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the DM’s choice that acts in accordance with its alignment and nature. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright-pink smoke.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>61-70</td><td>A hungry Bulette burrows up and attacks.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>71-80</td><td>A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined potions. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>81-90</td><td>A nest of 1d4 + 3 rainbow-colored eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 Force damage from an internal explosion.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>91-95</td><td>A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a burial chamber containing a Mummy, a Mummy Lord, or some other Undead of the DM’s choice. Its sarcophagus contains treasure of the DM’s choice.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>96-00</td><td>A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the DM’s choice. The top leads where the DM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant’s castle, or another plane of existence.</td></tr>

	<element name="Bag of Devouring" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide 2024" id="ID_WOTC_DMG24_MAGIC_ITEM_BAG_OF_DEVOURING">
		<description>
			<p>This bag resembles a <i>Bag of Holding</i> but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.</p>
			<p class="indent">The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can take an action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Another creature can take an action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, provided the puller isn’t pulled inside the bag first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions—roughly 2 feet square and 4 feet deep on the inside. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires a Utilize action.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. The bag holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>
			<p class="indent">Placing a <i>Bag of Holding</i> inside an extradimensional space created by a <i>Heward’s Handy Haversack</i>, <i>Portable Hole</i>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can’t be reopened.</p>

			<p>This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 Beads of Force are found together.</p>

Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are partially within the area are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can pass through.</p>
			<p class="indent">An enclosed creature can take a Utilize action to push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s Speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the <i>Book of Exalted Deeds</i> figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book’s authors filled the pages with their own visions of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.</p>
			<p class="indent">The <i>Book of Exalted Deeds</i> rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring hope to an endangered world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.</p>
			<p class="indent">A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book’s contents secure. Only a creature that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits.</p>
			<p class="indent">Other creatures that peruse the book’s open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. A Fiend, an Undead, or a servant of a god from the Lower Planes that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 Radiant damage. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity, and it can’t be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage disappears in a flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. The book then vanishes, and the creature’s Attunement to it ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.</p>
			<p><b><i>Celestial Calm.</i></b> While attuned to the book, you have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions and Resistance to Psychic damage. These benefits become permanent after you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book.</p>
			<p><b><i>Divine Wisdom.</i></b> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can’t gain this benefit from the book more than once.</p>
			<p><b><i>Enlightened Magic.</i></b> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.</p>
			<p><b><i>Halo.</i></b> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a Bonus Action. While present, the halo gives you Advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks. In addition, Fiends and Undead within the halo’s Bright Light make attack rolls against you with Disadvantage.</p>
			<p><b><i>Random Properties.</i></b> The <i>Book of Exalted Deeds</i> has the following random properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>2 major beneficial properties</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Destroying the Book.</i></b> The <i>Book of Exalted Deeds</i> can’t be destroyed. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The contents of this foul manuscript are the meat and drink of the wicked. It contains knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites doom.</p>
			<p class="indent">Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the <i>Book of Vile Darkness.</i> He recorded in its pages every horrid idea, every corrupt thought, and every example of foul magic he came across or devised.</p>
			<p class="indent">Other practitioners of evil have added their own input to the book’s catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn, or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can’t be divined.</p>
			<p class="indent">Nature can’t abide the book’s presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, common animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever a creature that isn’t a Fiend or an Undead attunes to the <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i>, that creature makes a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is magically transformed into a Larva under the DM’s control. Only a <i>Wish</i> spell can reverse this vile transformation.</p>
<!--			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>VILE LORE</h5>
				<p>The <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i> touches on every evil in the cosmos. A character can use the lore the book contains to unearth terrible secrets no mortal should know. Among the contents a character might find are the following, plus whatever else you choose:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Vile Apotheosis.</b> The book could hold a ritual that allows a character to become a lich or death knight.</li>
					<li><b>True Names.</b> The true names of any number of fiends might be in the book.</li>
					<li><b>Dark Magic.</b> Several spells of horrific evil of the DM’s design and choosing could be in the book. Spells could impose dreadful curses, disfigure others, require human sacrifice, afflict creatures with crippling pain, spread vile plagues, and so on.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>-->
			<p class="indent">A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and use its Adjusted Ability Scores, Tireless Form, Spells, Vile Lore, and Vile Speech properties.</p>
			<p class="indent">The <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i> remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears, your Attunement to it ends immediately, and you lose all benefits granted by it. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can’t be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.</p>
			<p><b><i>Adjusted Ability Scores.</i></b> One ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can’t adjust your ability scores again.</p>
			<p><b><i>Tireless Form.</i></b> While the book is on your person, you have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition.</p>
			<p><b><i>Random Properties.</i></b> The <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i> has the following random properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>3 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>1 major beneficial property</li>
				<li>3 minor detrimental properties</li>
				<li>2 major detrimental properties</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b><i>Spells.</i></b> While holding the book and holding it, you can cast the following spells (save DC 18) from it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Animate Dead</i></li>
				<li><i>Circle of Death</i></li>
				<li><i>Dominate Monster</i></li>
				<li><i>Finger of Death</i></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">Once you use the book to cast a spell, you can’t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.</p>
			<p><b><i>Dark Lore.</i></b> You can reference the <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i> whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, you have Advantage on that check.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the DM’s discretion, the book might reveal secrets no mortal should know, such as the true names of powerful Fiends, foul rites that allow one to transform into a death knight or lich, or long-lost spells crafted by beings so evil their names ought never to be spoken aloud.</p>
			<p><b><i>Vile Speech.</i></b> While the book is on your person, you can take a Magic action to recite words from its pages in a foul, dead language. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 Psychic damage, and each creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 Psychic damage unless the creature is a Fiend or an Undead.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Destroying the Book.</i></b> The <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i> allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it re-forms in some far corner of the multiverse.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature attuned to the book for 100 years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book re-forms 1d10 × 100 years later.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As a Magic action, you can place this 1-inch adamantine statuette on the ground and, using a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a square adamantine tower. Repeating the command word causes the tower to revert to statuette form, which works only if the tower is empty. Each creature in the area where the tower appears is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried are also pushed clear of the tower.</p>
			<p class="indent">The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder, staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting them. This ladder, staircase, or ramp ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When created, the tower has a single door at ground level on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the Knock spell and similar magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Magic prevents the tower from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20; HP 100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage except that which is dealt by siege equipment; and Resistance to all other damage. Shrinking the tower back down to statuette form doesn’t repair damage to the tower. Only a <i>Wish</i> spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of level 8 or lower). Each casting of Wish causes the tower to regain all its Hit Points.</p>

			<p>This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can take a Magic action to remove the stopper and issue one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following command words:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><i>Splash.</i></b> The decanter produces 1 gallon of water.</li>
				<li><b><i>Fountain.</i></b> The decanter produces 5 gallons of water.</li>
				<li><b><i>Geyser.</i></b> The decanter produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a Line 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. If you’re holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser in one direction (no action required). One creature of your choice in the Line must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone condition. Instead of a creature, you can target one object in the Line that isn’t being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is knocked over by the geyser.</li>

		<description>
			<p>This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34 cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.</p>
			<p class="indent">The magic of the deck functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the <i>Deck of Illusions</i> table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel Magic spell or a similar effect). When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can’t be used again.</p>

			<p>Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the <i>Deck of Many Things</i> table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.</p>
			<p class="indent">Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)</p>

			<p>Each card’s effect is described below.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Balance.</i></b> You can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You can’t decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Comet.</i></b> The next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 Hit Points or you don’t choose a foe, this card has no effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Donjon.</i></b> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you’re wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t be located by any Divination magic, but a <i>Wish</i> spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Euryale.</i></b> The card’s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the <i>Fates</i> card can end this curse.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>The Fates.</i></b> Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Flames.</i></b> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>A Question of Emnity</h5>
				<p>Two of the cards in the <i>Deck of Many Things</i> can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil.</p>
				<p class="indent">In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Fool.</i></b> You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn’t count as one of your declared draws.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Gem.</i></b> Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Jester.</i></b> You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Key.</i></b> A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The DM chooses the weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Knight.</i></b> You gain the service of a Knight, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your DM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Moon.</i></b> You gain the ability to cast <i>Wish</i> 1d3 times.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Puzzle.</i></b> Puzzle. Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Rogue.</i></b> An NPC of the DM’s choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don’t know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a <i>Wish</i> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ruin.</i></b> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide), it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sage.</i></b> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Skull.</i></b> An <i>Avatar of Death</i> appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can’t be restored to life.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Star.</i></b> Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sun.</i></b> A magic item (chosen by the DM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit Points daily at dawn until you die.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Talons.</i></b> Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Throne.</i></b> You gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>The Void.</i></b> Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM’s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A <i>Wish</i> spell can’t return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.</p>

	<element name="Demonomicon of Iggwilv" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide 2024" id="ID_WOTC_DMG24_MAGIC_ITEM_DEMONOMICON_OF_IGGWILV">
		<description>
			<p>This treatise, composed by Iggwilv the archmage, documents the Abyss’s layers and inhabitants and is widely regarded as the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book’s spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.</p>
			<p><b><i>Abyssal Lore.</i></b> You can reference the <i>Demonomicon</i> whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you gain Advantage on the check.</p>
			<p><b><i>Containment.</i></b> The first ten pages of the <i>Demonomicon</i> are blank. As a Magic action while holding the book, you can target a Fiend that you can see that is trapped within the area of a Magic Circle spell. The Fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with Disadvantage or become trapped within one of the <i>Demonomicon’s</i> blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature’s widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you finish a Long Rest, if you and the <i>Demonomicon</i> are on the same plane of existence, one trapped creature within the book can attempt to possess you. You make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. As a Magic action, the possessing creature can release you and appear in the closest unoccupied space to you. On a successful save, the Fiend can’t try to possess you again for 7 days (but another Fiend trapped in the book can certainly try).</p>
			<p class="indent">When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 Fiends occupying its pages—typically an assortment of demons.</p>
			<p><b><i>Ensnarement.</i></b> While carrying the book, whenever you cast <i>Magic Circle</i> naming only Fiends or cast <i>Planar Binding</i> targeting a Fiend, the spell is cast at level 9, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the Fiend has Disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.</p>
			<p><b><i>Fiendish Scourging.</i></b> While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a Fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.</p>
			<p><b><i>Random Properties.</i></b> The Artifact has the following random properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
				<li>1 major detrimental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b><i>Spells.</i></b> The book has 8 charges and regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the book, you can take a Magic action to cast one of the spells (save DC 20) on the following table. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Spell</td><td>Charge Cost</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr><td><i>Magic Circle</i></td><td>1</td></tr>
					<tr><td><i>Magic Jar</i></td><td>3</td></tr>
					<tr><td><i>Planar Ally</i></td><td>3</td></tr>
					<tr><td><i>Planar Binding</i></td><td>2</td></tr>
					<tr><td><i>Plane Shift</i> (to the Abyss only)</td><td>3</td></tr>
					<tr><td><i>Summon Fiend</i></td><td>3</td></tr>
					<tr><td><i>Tasha’s Hideous Laughter</i></td><td>0</td></tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p><b><i>Destroying the Demonomicon.</i></b> To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book’s pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book’s remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semisentient domain lies a long-lost Artifact, <i>Fraz-Urb’luu’s Staff</i>. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and out-of-date copy of the <i>Tome of Zyx</i>, the work that served as the foundation of the <i>Demonomicon of Iggwilv</i>. The <i>Tome of Zyx</i> can be destroyed like any ordinary book. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb’luu knows instantly.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You can take a Utilize action to place these shackles on a creature that has the Incapacitated condition. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.</p>
			<p class="indent">You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can take a Utilize action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.</p>

			<p class="indent">You can issue another command as a Magic action to make the illuminated globe rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light winks out.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This powder resembles fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you take a Utilize action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within a 10-foot Emanation originating from you have the Invisible condition for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. Immediately after an affected creature makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell, the Invisible condition ends for that creature.</p>

			<p>This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot Cube of water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. A creature can take a Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Elemental or a Water Weird). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

				<li><b>Goat of Terror</b> This figurine can become a <i>Giant Goat</i> for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a <i>+1 Lance</i>, and the other becomes a <i>+2 Longsword</i>. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.</li>
				<li><b>Goat of Traveling.</b> This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a <i>Riding Horse</i>. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.</li>
				<li><b>Goat of Travail.</b> This figurine can become a <i>Giant Goat</i> for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>

		<description>
			<p>A <i>Figurine of Wondrous Power</i> is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified below.</p>
			<p><b><i>Obsidian Steed (Very Rare).</i></b> This polished obsidian horse can become a <i>Nightmare</i> for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.</p>
			<p class="indent">The figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.</p>

				<li><b>Second Command Word.</b> You expend 1 charge and cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
				<li><b>Third Command Word.</b> You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.</p>

A hag coven can have only one <i>Hag Eye</i> at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a special rite. This rite takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it if one or more of them has the Incapacitated condition. If the hags take any other actions during this rite, the rite fails and ends.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Vecna was a mighty wizard who, through magic and conquest, forged a terrible empire. For all his power, however, Vecna feared death and took steps to prevent his demise by becoming a lich.</p>
			<p class="indent">A treacherous lieutenant named Kas brought Vecna's rule to an end in a terrible battle. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work Vecna's will in the world.</p>
			<p class="indent">The <i>Eye of Vecna</i> and the <i>Hand of Vecna</i> are separate Artifacts that might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a shriveled left extremity.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Random Properties of the Eye and Hand.</i></b> The <i>Hand of Vecna</i> has the following random properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1 minor beneficial property</li>
				<li>1 major beneficial property</li>
				<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b><i>Attuning to the Hand</i></b> To attune to the hand, you must press it against the stump where your left hand was. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.</p>
			<p><b><i>Properties of the Hand.</i></b> When you are attuned to the hand, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Great Strength.</i></b> Your Strength becomes 20 unless it is already 20 or higher.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Icy Touch.</i></b> Any melee spell attack you make with the hand and any melee attack made with a weapon held by it deals an extra 2d8 Cold damage on a hit.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting</i></b> The hand has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can cast a spell on the <i>Hand of Vecna</i> Spells table from the hand (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell from it, the hand casts <i>Suggestion</i> on you (save DC 18; no Concentration required), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.</p>

			<p><b><i>Destroying the Eye and Hand.</i></b> If the <i>Eye of Vecna</i> and the <i>Hand of Vecna</i> are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the <i>Sword of Kas</i>, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the Artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.</p>

			<p>This pointed hat has the following properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Focus.</i></b> While holding the hat, you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells. Any spell you cast using the hat gains a special Somatic component: you must reach into the hat and "pull" the spell out of it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Unknown Spell.</i></b> While holding the hat, you can try to cast a level 1+ spell you don't know. The spell must be on the Wizard spell list, it must be of a level you can cast, and it can't have Material components costing more than 1,000 GP. Once you decide on the spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level. Then, to determine whether you cast the spell, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell using its normal casting time, and you can't use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. On a failed check, you fail to cast the spell and a random effect occurs instead, determined by rolling on the following table.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any spell you cast from the hat uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the following benefits while wearing the helm.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><b><i>Diamond Light.</i></b> As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits a 30-foot Emanation. When at least one Undead is within that area, the Emanation is filled with Dim Light. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 Radiant damage.</li>
				<li><b><i>Fire Opal Flames.</i></b> As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can take a Magic action to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 Fire damage. The fl ames last until you take a Bonus Action to extinguish them or until you drop or stow the weapon.</li>
				<li><b><i>Ruby Resistance.</i></b> As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have Resistance to Fire damage.</li>
				<li><b><i>Spells.</i></b> You can cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: <i>Daylight</i> (opal), <i>Fireball</i> (fire opal), <i>Prismatic Spray</i> (diamond), or <i>Wall of Fire</i> (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b><i>Taking Fire Damage.</i></b> Roll 1d20 if you are wearing the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems and is then destroyed. Each creature within a 60-foot Emanation originating from you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking Radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet. The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.</p>
			<p class="indent">Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.</p>
			<p class="indent">If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an Artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>
			<p class="indent">Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a <i>Bag of Holding</i>, <i>Portable Hole</i>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>

The magical effects have neither substance nor sound, and they are obviously illusory. The effects end when you stop playing.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This musical instrument has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While you are playing it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and write a magical message on a nonmagical object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The message can be up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a Bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical Darkness. Casting the <i>Dispel Magic</i> spell on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours.</p>

			<p class="indent">When you take a Magic action to toss an <i>Ioun Stone</i> into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you while doing so. You can have up to three <i>Ioun Stones</i> orbiting your head at the same time.</p>

			<p>While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a creature you can see.

The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.</p>
			<p class="indent">Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a command that releases it. Doing so or missing with the attack causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature that can touch the bands, including the one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands. On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>While holding this brass-stoppered iron flask, you can take a Magic action to target a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask is empty and the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't age and doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can take a Magic action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature in the flask. The creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour, understanding those commands even if it doesn't know the language in which the commands are given. If you issue no commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its death or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.</p>
			<p class="indent">An <i>Identify</i> spell reveals if the flask contains a creature, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered Iron Flask might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly by rolling on the following table (see the Monster Manual for the creature's stat block).</p>

		<description>
			<p>When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror's nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.</p>
			<p class="indent">An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.</p>
			<p class="indent">While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate.</p>
			<p class="indent">In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a <i>Bag of Holding</i>, <i>Portable Hole</i>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>

	<element name="Nolzur’s Marvelous Pigments" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide 2024" id="ID_WOTC_DMG24_MAGIC_ITEM_NOLZURS_MARVELOUS_PIGMENTS">
		<description>
			<p>This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total). Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube. The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you leave the Cube before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the work is done, all the painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within the 20-foot Cube.</p>
			<p class="indent">No object created by a pot of pigment can have a value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all objects created by a pot of pigment can't exceed 500 GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close inspection reveals they're made from paste, cookies, or some other worthless material.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm.</p>

	<element name="Orb of Dragonkind" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide 2024" id="ID_WOTC_DMG24_MAGIC_ITEM_ORB_OF_DRAGONKIND">
		<description>
			<p>Long ago, in the Dragonlance setting, elves and humans waged a terrible war against chromatic dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and forged five Orbs of Dragonkind to help defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped over the centuries. Their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, but they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those who try to wield an orb's magic but lack sufficient force of personality might find themselves under the orb's control.</p>
			<p class="indent">An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>
			<p class="indent">While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic action to peer into the orb's depths. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the Charmed condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you are Charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts <i>Suggestion</i> on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the DM decides.</p>
			<p><b><i>Random Properties.</i></b> An <i>Orb of Dragonkind</i> has the following random properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
				<li>1 major detrimental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b><i>Spells.</i></b> The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Spell</td><td>Charge Cost</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr><td><i>Cure Wounds</i> (level 9 version)</td><td>4</td></tr>
					<tr><td><i>Daylight</i></td><td>1</td></tr>
					<tr><td><i>Death Ward</i></td><td>2</td></tr>
					<tr><td><i>Detect Magic</i></td><td>0</td></tr>
					<tr><td><i>Scrying</i> (save DC 18)</td><td>3</td></tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p><b><i>Call Dragons.</i></b> While you control the orb, you can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b><i>Destroying an Orb.</i></b> An <i>Orb of Dragonkind</i> has AC 20 and is destroyed if it takes damage from a +3 Weapon or a <i>Disintegrate</i> spell. Nothing else can harm it.</p>

		<description>
			<p>While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rats and giant rats are Indifferent toward you and won't attack you unless you threaten or harm them.</p>
			<p class="indent">The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus Action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one <i>Swarm of Rats</i> with each expended charge if enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever a <i>Swarm of Rats</i> that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes Friendly to you and your allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn more than 30 feet away from you, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can take a Magic action to unfold a <i>Portable Hole</i> and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the <i>Portable Hole</i> creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open <i>Portable Hole</i> can exit the hole by climbing out of it.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can take a Magic action to close a <i>Portable Hole</i> by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed <i>Portable Hole</i> holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>
			<p class="indent">Placing a <i>Portable Hole</i> inside an extradimensional space created by a <i>Bag of Holding</i>, <i>Heward's Handy Haversack</i>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>

Roll any die to determine whether the coin comes up heads (on an even number) or tails (on an odd number). The roll also determines the effect:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><b>Heads.</b> Target one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d4 Psychic damage and has Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.</li>
				<li><b>Tails.</b> You take 1d4 Psychic damage.</li>

That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet at the start of each of your subsequent turns until reaching its destination or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advantage on ability checks made to climb using the rope.</p>
			<p class="indent">The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.</p>

			<p>This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a Magic action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself.

			<p>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.</p>
			<p class="indent">The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a <i>Sphere of Annihilation</i>, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.</p>
			<p><b><i>Controlling the Sphere.</i></b> A <i>Sphere of Annihilation</i> is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line.</p>
			<p class="indent">While in control of the sphere, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains.</p>
			<p><b><i>Sphere Interactions.</i></b> If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the <i>Gate</i> spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a <i>Portable Hole</i>), the DM determines randomly what happens using the following table.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>1d100</td><td>Result</td></tr>

				<tbody>
					<tr><td>01-50</td><td>The sphere is destroyed.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>51-85</td><td>The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.</td></tr>

		<description>
			<p>This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A Fiend or an Undead that touches the talisman takes 8d6 Radiant damage and takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.</p>
			<p><b><i>Holy Symbol.</i></b> You can use the talisman as a Holy Symbol. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.</p>
			<p><b><i>Pure Rebuke.</i></b> The talisman has 7 charges. While wearing or holding the talisman, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. A flaming fissure opens under the target, and the target makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is a Fiend or an Undead, it has Disadvantage on the save. On a failed save, the target falls into the fissure and is destroyed, leaving no remains. On a successful save, the target isn't cast into the fissure but takes 4d6 Psychic damage from the ordeal. In either case, the fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman disperses into motes of golden light and is destroyed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This book has a desiccated tongue pinned to its front cover. Five of these tomes exist, and it's unknown which one is the original. The tongue on the first <i>Tome of the Stilled Tongue</i> belonged to a treacherous former servant of the lich Vecna. The tongues pinned to the covers of the four copies came from other spellcasters who crossed Vecna. The first few pages of each tome are filled with indecipherable scrawls. The remaining pages are blank.</p>
			<p class="indent">While attuned to this item, you can use it as a Spellbook and an Arcane Focus. In addition, while holding the tome, you can take a Bonus Action to cast a spell you have written in this tome, without expending a spell slot or using any Verbal or Somatic components. Once used, this property of the tome can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">Only you can remove the tongue from the book's cover. If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.</p>
			<p class="indent">Vecna watches anyone using this tome and can write cryptic messages in it. These messages typically fade away after they are read.</p>
