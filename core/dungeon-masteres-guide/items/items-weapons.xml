		<description>
			<p>A young dwarf prince set out to forge a weapon that would be regarded as a symbol of unity among his people. Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, a god of creation, he first crafted four mighty tools: the <i>Starmetal Pick</i>, the <i>Earthheart Forge</i>, the <i>Anvil of Songs</i>, and the <i>Shaping Hammer</i>. With these tools, he forged the <i>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Armed with the Artifact, the prince brought peace to the dwarf clans, ending grudges and answering slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.</p>
			<p class="indent">Later, in an era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.</p>
			<p><b><i>Magic Weapon.</i></b> The <i>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</i> is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you attack a creature with the axe and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the axe deals an extra 20 Slashing damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">The axe has Thrown with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is a creature of the Giant type. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.</p>
			<p><b><i>Blessings of Moradin.</i></b> While attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Fortitude of Stone.</i></b> Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Gifts of the Creator.</i></b> You have proficiency with Brewer's Supplies, Mason's Tools, and Smith's Tools.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>One with the Forge.</i></b> You have Immunity to Poison damage and Resistance to Fire damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sunder.</i></b> When you hit an object with the axe, the object takes the maximum amount of damage possible.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Conjure Earth Elemental.</i></b> While holding the axe, you can take a Magic action to summon an Earth Elemental. It appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 24 hours, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Random Properties.</i></b> The axe has the following randomly determined properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>1 major beneficial property</li>
				<li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Travel the Depths.</i></b> You can take a Magic action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast Teleport from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Destroying the Axe.</i></b> The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the <i>Earthheart Forge</i>, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for 50 years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your Hit Point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Curse.</i></b> This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have Disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever another creature damages you while the weapon is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. This berserk state ends when you start your turn and there are no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.</p>
			<p class="indent">While berserk, you regard the creature nearest to you that you can see or hear as your enemy. If there are multiple possible creatures, choose one at random. On each of your turns, you must move as close to the creature as possible and take the Attack action, targeting the creature. If you're unable to get close enough to the creature to attack it with the weapon, your turn ends after you've used up all your available movement. If the creature dies or can no longer be seen or heard by you, the next nearest creature that you can see or hear becomes your new target.</p>

	<element name="Blackrazor" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide 2024" id="ID_WOTC_DMG24_MAGIC_ITEM_BLACKRAZOR">
		<description>
			<p>Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, <i>Blackrazor</i> shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of cut obsidian.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you hit an Undead with this weapon, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage, and the target regains 1d10 Hit Points. If this Necrotic damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, <i>Blackrazor</i> devours your soul (see "Devour Soul" below).</p>
			<p class="indent">While you hold this weapon, you have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions, and you have Blindsight with a range of 30 feet.</p>
			<p><b><i>Devour Soul.</i></b> Whenever you use <i>Blackrazor</i> to reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points, the sword slays the creature and devours its soul unless it is a Construct or an Undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by <i>Blackrazor</i> can be restored to life only by a <i>Wish</i> spell.</p> 
			<p class="indent">When <i>Blackrazor</i> devours a soul that isn't yours, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the slain creature's Hit Point maximum.</p> 
			<p><b><i>Haste.</i></b> <i>Blackrazor</i> can cast <i>Haste</i> on you, after which it can't cast this spell again until the next dawn. <i>Blackrazor</i> decides when to cast the spell, which takes effect at the start of your turn. The spell lasts for 1 minute (no Concentration required) or until <i>Blackrazor</i> decides to end it, which it can do at the end of any of your turns.</p>
			<p><b><i>Sentience.</i></b> <i>Blackrazor</i> is a sentient Chaotic Neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.</p> 
			<p class="indent">The weapon speaks Common and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, <i>Blackrazor</i> also understands every language you know.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Personality.</i></b> <i>Blackrazor</i> speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed. The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. <i>Blackrazor</i> is meant to hurry that process along.</p> 
			<p class="indent">Despite its nihilism, <i>Blackrazor</i> feels a strange kinship to <i>Wave</i> and <i>Whelm</i>, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be reunited and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with <i>Whelm</i> and finds <i>Wave</i> tedious.</p> 
			<p class="indent"><i>Blackrazor's</i> hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes 3 days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.</p>
			<p><b><i>Destroying Blackrazor.</i></b> <i>Blackrazor</i> can be destroyed by crushing it in the great gears of Mechanus. Primus, the creator of the modrons, also knows a series of musical tones that <i>Blackrazor</i> can't stand to hear, causing the sword to shatter.</p>

			<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can take a Bonus Action to magically coat the blade with poison. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 Poison damage and have the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. The weapon can't be used this way again until the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You can take a Bonus Action to toss this magic weapon into the air. When you do so, the weapon begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of itself. The weapon uses your attack roll and adds your ability modifier to damage rolls.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the weapon hovers, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same Bonus Action, you can cause the weapon to attack one creature within 5 feet of the weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">After the hovering weapon attacks for the fourth time, it flies back to you and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, the weapon falls to the ground in your space. If the weapon has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or are more than 30 feet away from it.</p>

			<p class="indent">The first time you attack with the weapon on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the weapon's bonus to your Armor Class. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack rolls and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has no string. Each time you pull your arm back in a firing motion, a magical arrow made of golden energy appears nocked and ready to fire. An arrow produced by this weapon deals Force damage instead of Piercing damage on a hit, and it disappears after it hits or misses its target. Until it disappears, the arrow emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.</p>
			<p>This weapon has the following additional properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Arrow of Restraint.</i></b> Whenever you use this weapon to make a ranged attack against a creature, you can try to restrain the target instead of dealing damage to it. If the arrow hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition for 1 minute. As an action, a creature Restrained by an arrow can make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to try to break the restraint, ending the effect on itself on a successful check.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Arrow of Transport.</i></b> As a Magic action, you can fire one energy arrow from this weapon at a target you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target can be either a willing Medium or smaller creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried, provided the object is small enough to fit inside a 5-foot Cube. The arrow teleports the target to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Energy Ladder.</i></b> As a Magic action, you can loose a flurry of energy arrows from this weapon at a wall up to 60 feet away from yourself. The arrows become glowing rungs that stick out of the wall, forming a magical ladder up to 60 feet long on the wall. This ladder lasts for 1 minute before disappearing.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Of all the magic items created by elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a <i>Moonblade.</i> In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such weapon. Over the centuries, some of these weapons have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Others have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.</p>
			<p class="indent">Every <i>Moonblade</i> longs for a bearer whose disposition and goals are compatible with its own. If you try to attune to a <i>Moonblade</i> that doesn't want you as its bearer, the weapon not only rejects you but also places a curse on you, causing you to make D20 Tests with Disadvantage for 24 hours or until the curse is ended by a <i>Remove Curse</i> spell or similar magic. If you're accepted by the weapon and try to attune to it, you become attuned to it instantly, and a new rune appears on it. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. A <i>Moonblade</i> functions like a nonmagical weapon of its kind for anyone other than its chosen bearer.</p>
			<p class="indent">A <i>Moonblade</i> has one rune on it for each bearer it has willingly served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the <i>Moonblade</i> an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly by rolling on the Moonblade Properties table.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Minor Property.</i></b> In addition to its aforementioned properties, each <i>Moonblade</i> has a minor property determined by rolling on the Magic Item's Minor Property table.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sentience.</i></b> A <i>Moonblade</i> is a sentient weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet. Its alignment matches that of its creator.</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate through visions or dreams when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Personality.</i></b> A <i>Moonblade</i> has a personality similar to that of its creator. Once a <i>Moonblade</i> has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the bearer's alignment differs from that of the weapon's or the bearer's goals later clash with the weapon's goals.</p>
			<h5>MOONBLADE PROPERTIES</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d100</td><td>Property</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>01-60</td><td>Increase the weapon's bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the <i>Moonblade</i> already has a +3 bonus.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>61-75</td><td>When you hit with an attack roll using the <i>Moonblade</i>, you deal an extra 1d6 Force damage. Each time the weapon gains this property after the first, the extra damage increases by 1d6, to a maximum of 3d6. Reroll if the <i>Moonblade</i> already deals an extra 3d6 Force damage on a hit.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>76-80</td><td>The <i>Moonblade</i> gains Thrown with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>81-85</td><td>The <i>Moonblade</i> scores a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>86-95</td><td>You can take a Bonus Action to cause the <i>Moonblade</i> to flash brightly. Each other creature that is within 30 feet of you and not behind Total Cover must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can't use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>96-99</td><td>The <i>Moonblade</i> has the properties of a <i>Ring of Spell Storing.</i></td></tr>
				<tr><td>100</td><td>You can take a Magic action to conjure a spectral entity that resembles a shadowy elf if you don't already have one serving you. The entity appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the Shadow stat block with these changes: it is a Fey, has a Neutral alignment, and doesn't create new shadows. You control this entity, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 Hit Points or you dismiss it as a Magic action.</td></tr>

The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time.

		<description>
			<p>Kas was a powerful warrior who served Vecna and whose loyalty was rewarded with this sword. As Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. The sword urged Kas to destroy Vecna and usurp his throne. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Bloodthirst.</i></b> The sword thirsts for blood. If the sword doesn't taste blood on its blade within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 Psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the Dominate Monster spell, and the sword demands blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Magic Weapon.</i></b> You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with the sword, which scores a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20 and deals an extra 2d10 Slashing damage to Undead.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><i>Call Lightning</i></li>
				<li><i>Divine Word</i></li>
				<li><i>Finger of Death</i></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.</p>
			<p><b><i>Spirit of Kas.</i></b> While the sword is on your person, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Battle Hunger.</i></b> You add 1d10 to your Initiative rolls.</p>

			<p><b><i>Sentience.</i></b> The <i>Sword of Kas</i> is a sentient Chaotic Evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.</p> 
			<p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Common.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Personality.</i></b> The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.</p>

			<p><b><i>Destroying the Sword.</i></b> A creature attuned to both the <i>Eye of Vecna</i> and the <i>Hand of Vecna</i> can use the <i>Wish</i> property of those combined Artifacts to unmake the <i>Sword of Kas</i>, provided the sword is within 30 feet of the spell's caster. Upon casting <i>Wish</i>, the creature makes a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, nothing happens, and the <i>Wish</i> spell is wasted. On a successful save, the <i>Sword of Kas</i> is destroyed.</p>

			<p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores Resistance to Slashing damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it has Immunity to Slashing damage, if it doesn't have or need a head, or if the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 30 Slashing damage from the hit. If the creature has Legendary Resistance, it can expend one daily use of that trait to avoid losing its head, taking the extra damage instead.</p>
