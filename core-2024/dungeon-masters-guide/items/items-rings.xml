		<description>
			<p>While wearing this ring, you can take a Magic action to summon a particular Djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air. The djinni appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of yourself. It remains as long as you maintain Concentration, to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 Hit Points.</p>
			<p class="indent">While summoned, the djinni is Friendly to you and your allies, and it obeys your commands. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.</p>
			<p class="indent">Rings of Djinni Summoning are often created by the djinn they summon and given to mortals as gifts of friendship or tokens of esteem.</p>

			<p>You can cast <i>Dancing Lights</i> or <i>Light</i> from the ring.</p>
			<p>The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges to use the properties below.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Faerie Fire.</i></b> You can expend 1 charge to cast <i>Faerie Fire</i> from the ring.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Lightning Spheres.</i></b> You can expend 2 charges as a Magic action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning</p>
			<p class="indent">Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot radius.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a Bonus Action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn't behind Total Cover, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Spheres</td><td>Lightning Damage</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr><td>1</td><td>4d12</td></tr>
					<tr><td>2</td><td>5d4</td></tr>
					<tr><td>3</td><td>2d6</td></tr>
					<tr><td>4</td><td>2d4</td></tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Shooting Stars.</i></b> You can expend 1 to 3 charges as a Magic action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 5 into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p>
			<p class="indent">While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>
