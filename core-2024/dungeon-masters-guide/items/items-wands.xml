		<description>
			<p>Crafted and wielded by Orcus, this ghastly wand slips from the demon lord's grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever the demon lord senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wand is topped with a skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. All Holy Water within 10 feet of the wand is destroyed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 Necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and, if it is a Humanoid, turns into a Zombie.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Magic Weapon.</i></b> You can wield the wand as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 Necrotic damage on a hit.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Random Properties.</i></b> The <i>Wand of Orcus</i> has the following random properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>1 major beneficial property</li>
				<li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>
				<li>1 major detrimental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">The detrimental properties of the <i>Wand of Orcus</i> are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Protection.</i></b> You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spells.</i></b> The wand has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.</p> 
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Spell</td><td>Charge Cost</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td><i>Animate Dead</i></td><td>1</td></tr>
				<tr><td><i>Blight</i></td><td>2</td></tr>
				<tr><td><i>Circle of Death</i></td><td>3</td></tr>
				<tr><td><i>Finger of Death</i></td><td>3</td></tr>
				<tr><td><i>Power Word Kill</i></td><td>4</td></tr>
				<tr><td><i>Speak with Dead</i></td><td>1</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p class="indent">While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).</p>
			<p><b><i>Call Undead.</i></b> While holding the wand, you can take a Magic action to conjure 15 Skeletons and 15 Zombies. These Undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until the next dawn, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">While holding the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of Undead, not just skeletons and zombies. These Undead don't perish at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.</p>
			<p><b><i>Sentience.</i></b> The <i>Wand of Orcus</i> is a sentient Chaotic Evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.</p> 
			<p class="indent">The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Abyssal and Common.</p>
			<p><b><i>Personality.</i></b> The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.</p>
			<p class="indent">To further Orcus's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.</p>
			<p><b><i>Destroying the Wand.</i></b> Destroying the <i>Wand of Orcus</i> requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.</p> 
			<p class="indent">Bathing the wand in positive energy (such as that which permeates the Positive Plane) causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly re-forms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.</p>

That location becomes the point of origin of a spell or other magical effect determined by rolling on the Wand of Wonder Effects table. Spells cast from the wand have a save DC of 15. If a spell's maximum range is normally less than 120 feet, it becomes 120 feet when cast from the wand. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the DM determines randomly which among them are affected.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Regaining Charges.</i></b> The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.</p>

				<tr><td>1d100</td><td>Effect</td></tr>
			</thead> 
				<tbody> 
				<tr><td>01-20</td><td>You cast a spell originating from the chosen point. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a 1-2, <i>Darkness</i>; on a 3-4, <i>Faerie Fire</i>; on a 5-6, <i>Fireball</i>; on a 7-8, <i>Slow</i>; on a 9-10, <i>Stinking Cloud</i>.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>21-25</td><td>Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you have the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>26-30</td><td>You cast <i>Gust of Wind</i>. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>31-35</td><td>Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you take 1d6 Psychic damage.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>36-40</td><td>Heavy rain falls for 1 minute in a 120-foot-high, 60-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. During that time, the area of effect is Lightly Obscured.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>41-45</td><td>A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 60-foot-high, 30-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes, during which time the area of effect is Heavily Obscured.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>46-50</td><td>You cast <i>Lightning Bolt</i>. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>51-55</td><td>The creature closest to the chosen point of origin is enlarged as if you had cast <i>Enlarge/Reduce</i> on it. If the target isn't you and can't be affected by that spell, you become the target instead.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>56-60</td><td>A magically formed creature appears in an unoccupied space as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. The creature isn't under your control, acts as it normally would, and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine which creature appears. On a 1, a Rhinoceros appears; on a 2, an Elephant appears; and on a 3-4, a Rat appears.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>61-64</td><td>Grass covers a 60-foot-radius circle of ground, with the center of that circle as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. Grass that's already there grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown for 1 minute.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>65-68</td><td>An object of the DM's choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the chosen point of origin, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. If there are no such objects in range, nothing happens.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>69-72</td><td>Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you shrink as if you had cast <i>Enlarge/Reduce</i> on yourself and remain in that state for 1 minute.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>73-77</td><td>Leaves grow from the creature nearest to the chosen point of origin. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>78-82</td><td>Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a burst of colorful, shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot Emanation. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>83-87</td><td>Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you cast <i>Invisibility</i> on yourself.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>88-92</td><td>Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand's tip in a Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the chosen point of origin. Each gem deals 1 Bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the Line.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>93-97</td><td>You cast <i>Polymorph</i>, targeting the creature closest to the chosen point of origin. Roll 1d4 to determine the target's new form. On a 1, the new form is a Black Bear; on a 2, the new form is a Giant Wasp; on a 3-4, the new form is a Frog.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>98-00</td><td>The creature closest to the chosen point of origin makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the Restrained condition and begins to turn to stone. While Restrained in this way, the creature repeats the save at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. On a failed save, the creature has the Petrified condition instead of the Restrained condition. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the <i>Greater Restoration</i> spell or similar magic.</td></tr>
